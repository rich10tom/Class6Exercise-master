1. In the navbar component, there is an input field that has a placeholder of 'Search'. Whenever you enter text in there, you should be able to click a button to be able to display whatever you search for in the search-results component(shown in the demo). It should show your history of what you search for.

2. Create a directive called 'RandomBackgroundColor' to apply to each 'search' that is in your search-results component. Each 'search' should have a random background color given to it. 

BONUS: Whenever you hover over a 'search' change the background color to another random color.

3. Publish your repo to GitHub. Work on a project for the rest of class.
